Proctoring AI is a technology designed to ensure that are exams are held without any use of unfair means. Currently, in this project I have restricted the candidate from using phone, switching 
window, unknown/multiple candidates, if the candidate is trying to use any of the unfair means any of these the window will get shut down and a report will be generated which will be sent to the 
admin. And exploring more ideas that can be added to the project.
